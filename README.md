# Rishi

**Rishi is an open-source AI coding agent for R:**

- **Context-aware:** sees and controls your Console, Environment, and Plots
- **Grounded in reality:** responses based on your code and package documentation
- **Privacy-first:** runs locally, your messages/code/data stay on your machine
- **Transparent:** fully open-source and auditable, control your own API keys

Works seamlessly as a RStudio Addin.

    <td width="70%" valign="top">Rishi is an open-source AI coding agent for R that integrates seamlessly into RStudio. Unlike ChatGPT and similar tools, Rishi sees your R project, data, and visualizations â€” no more copy-pasting context back and forth.</td>

    <td width="70%" valign="top">
      ChatGPT and similar tools lack awareness of your R project, data, and visualizations. To use them effectively, you must manually copy context back and forth from your IDE with every interaction.<br><br>
      Rishi automatically delivers relevant context from your Files, Environment, Console, and Plots panes to the LLM with every message. It can also work autonomously with these panes to accomplish tasks without constant hand-holding.

    <td width="70%" valign="top">Very. By default, your messages, code, and data remain on your local machine. Rishi runs locally and doesn't store information in the cloud. You're also in control of your own API keys so there are no surprise costs or concerns about your work being used to train models.</td>
